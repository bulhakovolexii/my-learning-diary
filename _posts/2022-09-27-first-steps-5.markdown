I decided to take part in the selection for a scholarship to study at an IT school under the [IT Generation](https://it-generation.gov.ua/) program.
IT Generation is a project of the Ministry of Digital Transformation together with partners, the Binance blockchain ecosystem and the Lviv IT Cluster.<!--more-->
It meant a tough selection during which I completed a lot of different test tasks, including logical ones, for knowledge of English and Javascript. Below I will provide links to the 2 largest assignments for js. These are self-checking tasks from the schools of [Go-IT](https://goit.global/ua/) and [Mate Academy](https://mate.academy/).

The syllabus of completed courses is below.

Based on the selection results, I received a grant for free education at the [Prog.academy](https://prog.academy/) school.
