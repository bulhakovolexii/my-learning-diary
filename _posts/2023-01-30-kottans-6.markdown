## Requirements
- complex implementation of full page responsive layout (Udacity course on adaptive HTML/CSS).
  - you can store data in an array of objects
  - you can use ```innerHTML, insertAdjacentHTML, append, createElement, addEventListener,```
  - array methods like ```Array#filter, Array#sort, Array#find,``` etc. will be useful.
  - and of course - DOM methods.

My impressions from the studied material:

Before completing this assignment, I already had some knowledge of how DOM-API works, but I had no practical experience with data structures. Of particular difficulty in this task were the issues of animation and the creation of an adaptive design of the side menu.
