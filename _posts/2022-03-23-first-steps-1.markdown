I work as a lecturer at NTU "KhPI", and my main discipline is the author's course on the basics of thermography.
After the Russian military invasion, I had to come up with some reliable, fast, multi-platform way to publish lecture notes, videos, useful links, literature, grade book, etc.
The best choice for me was Google Sites. It did not require hosting, it was a simple CMS, although not flexible enough. For me, some things turned out to be very difficult, especially adding multilingualism and finding a high-quality and free plugin for adding a block with comments to the site.
So I gained some experience, and I realized how important the flexibility of the tools used is. It was in the process of multiple attempts to squeeze the maximum out of the Google site that I realized that I needed to learn the basics of HTML / CSS.

The result of my work is shown below.
