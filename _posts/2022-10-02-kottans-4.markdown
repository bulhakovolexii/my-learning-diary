My impressions from the studied material:

Grid and Flex, are amazing technologies that made me want to put them into practice right away. Previously, I did a responsive design practice with only floating elements, which I found to be a much less intuitive way. The open question for me remains the use of Grid and Flex together, and when it is appropriate to use one of them.
