## Requirements
- no JavaScript, only HTML/CSS, preprocessors allowed
- no external libraries or frameworks
- web browser support: Chrome only (use the latest features)
- the popup is expected to have three states depending on user actions:
  - initial state: popups are not visible
  - after clicking the popup-button, the popup becomes visible or hidden if it is already open
  - click the "More" button to add 3 to 10 more icons and make the popup content scrollable

My impressions from the studied material:

This was my first experience of developing a complete finished project, without any pre-prepared basis. It was difficult for me to navigate my code. Because of this, I somewhat started everything from scratch. But this task helped to better navigate a relatively large document.
